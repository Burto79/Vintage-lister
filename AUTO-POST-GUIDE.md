## Checking for Sold Items

When running in auto mode, the system:

1. **Checks eBay every 5 minutes** for sold items
2. **Creates `TO-SHIP.json`** with shipping details:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "item": "Vintage 1960s Dress",
       "price": 45.00,
       "date": "2025-01-20",
       "orderId": "EBAY123456"
     }
   ]
   ```
3. **Shows console notification**:
   ```
   ðŸŽ‰ 1 item(s) sold! Time to ship:

   ðŸ“¦ SHIP THIS:
      Item: Vintage 1960s Dress
      Sold for: $45.00
      Sold on: 1/20/2025
      Order ID: EBAY123456
   ```

4. **Ship the item** - Check eBay for shipping label and address

## Tips for Best Results

### Photo Tips

- **Multiple angles**: Front, back, labels, details
- **Good lighting**: Natural light is best
- **Show flaws**: Close-ups of any damage
- **Include size tags**: If clothing
- **Plain background**: Helps AI focus on item

### Pricing Strategy

- Let AI suggest pricing (it uses extended thinking)
- AI considers: era, condition, rarity, market demand
- You can adjust in the draft if needed

### Categories

AI will auto-select the best eBay category based on:
- Item type (clothing, jewelry, decor, etc.)
- Era (1920s, 1960s, etc.)
- Style and condition

## Troubleshooting

### "Auto-post failed"

**Check:**
1. eBay credentials are correct in `.env`
2. OAuth token is not expired (regenerate if needed)
3. `EBAY_SANDBOX` matches your credentials (prod vs sandbox)

### "Photos not detected"

**Check:**
1. `WATCH_FOLDER` path is correct
2. Folder exists and is accessible
3. Photos are in supported formats (JPG, PNG, HEIC, WebP)

### "Analysis failed"

**Check:**
1. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is valid
2. You have API credits
3. Images are not corrupt

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Single Item (Quick Sale)

```bash
# 1. Take 2 photos on phone
# 2. Wait for sync (usually <30 seconds)
# 3. Auto mode detects photos
# 4. AI analyzes (20-30 seconds)
# 5. Posts to eBay automatically
# 6. Item is live!

Total time: ~1 minute from photo to live listing
```

### Example 2: Estate Sale Haul (50 items)

```bash
# 1. Take photos of all items
# 2. Start auto mode: npm run auto
# 3. Walk away - it processes everything
# 4. Come back to 50 live eBay listings
# 5. Check TO-SHIP.json for sales

Total time: ~30 minutes of AI work, 0 minutes of your work
```

### Example 3: Thrift Store Find (Unsure of Value)

```bash
# 1. Use web interface for careful review
# 2. Upload photos
# 3. Run analysis
# 4. Review AI's assessment
# 5. Decide: auto-post or adjust pricing
# 6. Post when ready
```

---

## Advanced: Custom Workflows

### Only Auto-Analyze (No Posting)

```bash
npm run auto -- --no-auto-post
```

- Analyzes photos
- Saves drafts
- You review and post manually

### Disable Sale Notifications

```bash
npm run auto -- --no-notifications
```

- Still auto-posts
- Doesn't check for sales
- Manual sale checking

---

## File Structure

When running, you'll see these folders:

```
vintage-lister/
â”œâ”€â”€ processed-photos/     # Auto-archived after processing
â”œâ”€â”€ drafts/              # Saved drafts (if not auto-posting)
â”œâ”€â”€ active-listings/     # Currently listed items
â”œâ”€â”€ uploads/             # Web uploads
â””â”€â”€ TO-SHIP.json        # Items that sold (CHECK THIS!)
```

---

## The Complete Automation

Once set up, your workflow is literally:

1. **ðŸ“¸ See something vintage at thrift store**
2. **ðŸ“± Take 1-2 photos**
3. **â˜• Get coffee**
4. **âœ… Item is live on eBay when you get back**
5. **ðŸ”” Get notification when it sells**
6. **ðŸ“¦ Ship it**
7. **ðŸ’° Money in account**

**That's it!** The AI handles everything in between.
